# :video_game: Breakout Game
 In this project I created the game Breakout. This game has various levels of varying blocks that are destroyed with a ball. There is a paddle that is controlled by the player that bounces the ball back up towards the blocks. The paddle moves right and left. I did this using classes and various functions. The main things I used to achieve this were functions with for loops and if statements. I also used onkeypress as a large part of my game and changing the screens.

# :joystick: Design
The goal is to bounce the ball off of the walls and paddle to destroy all of the blocks. The ball will bounce off all walls, blocks, and the paddle, other than the bottom. If the ball reaches the bottom the game is lost. The instructions read as: Press the left and right arrow to stop the ball from leaving the screen. Break all the Blocks. You score a point per broken block. Your score will quickly flash when each point is scored. After the blocks are all broken follow instructions to go to the next level. DO NOT do instructions early or you will miss points. Press Space to Start! I made my own game as the initial extension but to extend this game I made more complicated collisions, kept the ball inside the screen, kept an onscreen score, made a start screen, a level 1, a level 2, and a game over screen.
